# HashMap Implementation

This is the 1st Coursework for F28DA Data Structures & Algorithms, 2nd year of Bsc Computer Science.

This is a program that implements a HashMap using Linked List Data Structure in one file and map Data Structure in another. It compares the running time between the two implementations. This is my version of it.

The source code for this program has been encrypted in HashMapImplementation.zip due to the coursework being still used. 

If you want to have a look at the code, password can be requested from wrt_95@hotmail.com.
